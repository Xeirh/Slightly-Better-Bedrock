# Slightly Better Bedrock - Version 1.0.1
Minecraft Bedrock resource pack and behavior pack. This pack is aiming to improve the vanilla gameplay by bringing back older recipes that have been removed and even adding recipes some wish we had. This pack will have achivements enabled when the spring update feature is released. If used before hand, you will need to nbt modify your would data and re-enable achivements and after that you can enjoy.

# Update Future
  - Adding Furnace Minecart Back

# Formatting
  - Minimum Engine Version 1.21.50 
  - Recipe Format Version 1.21.50
  - Item Format Version 1.21.30

# Issues
  - If ever hit with the `"Error when applying content. Some of the selected content could not be applied."` on realms. This can be fixed by generating four new uuids for the manifest.json for both packs, Two unique uuids for the resource and two unique uuids for the behavior. Inside the dependencies, you will see another uuid. This is the uuid from the other packs header. For these packs to work correctly, you need to use the resource header uuid inside the behavior dependencies and vice versa.
